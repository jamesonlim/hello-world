# hello-world
Hi, I'm Jameson!

I have finished my undergrad back in 2017, and been working as a financial analyst at fortune 200 homebuilder! 
Out of curiosity and with a strong urge to develop my personal skills, I have set my foot in a world of coding.

...and guess what! I am enjoying it soooo much :)
